"Rather than a reference to the entire String, hello is a reference to a portion of the String, specified in the extra 
[0..5] bit. We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying [starting_index..ending_index], where 
starting_index is the first position in the slice and ending_index is one more than the last position in the slice. "

--------
first and last can be replaced with nothing, ea:

let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2]; // same as:
let slice = &s[..2];

let len = s.len(); ((why not ref?)

let slice = &s[3..len]; // same as:
let slice = &s[3..];

let slice = &s[0..len]; //entire string // same as:
let slice = &s[..];
