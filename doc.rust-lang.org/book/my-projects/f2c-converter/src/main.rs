//rust docs declares functions after main and chat-gpt before. The advantage with declaring them before is that it feels a bit more logical, on the other hand; the advantage of writing them after is that it makes them a bit more abstract and may help when starting with psudocode. 
//I think I will functions after main for now.

    // now lets convert, or pharse, as a in integer (i32):
